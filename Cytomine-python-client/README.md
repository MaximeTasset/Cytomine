Cytomine (http://www.cytomine.be/) client and utilities in Python.

Cytomine client contains functions to import/export data (projects, ontologies, images, users, annotations, softwares, ...) from/to Cytomine core server based on the RESTful API.

Cytomine utilities contains various functions including ones to access whole slide images (tiles,...) and basic image processing tools.

See examples in https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-python-client/tree/master/client/examples and https://github.com/cytomine/Cytomine-python-client/tree/master/utilities/examples

The client is automatically installed with the Docker/Bootstrap procedure, however it is possible to install it independently
on remote computers. See installation instructions here:
