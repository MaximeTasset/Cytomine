#Example to run an object finder over a whole gigapixel image

#0. Edit the add_software.py file to add the software to Cytomine Core (once) and project (once)

#1. Edit following XXX and 0 values with your cytomine identifiers

#2. Replace XXX values by your settings
cytomine_host="XXX"
cytomine_public_key="XXX" #if human user then creates a new userjob, otherwise use provided userjob keys
cytomine_private_key="XXX"
cytomine_id_project=XXX
cytomine_id_image=XXX
cytomine_id_software=XXX
cytomine_predict_term=XXX #id of term to associate to objects detected by object finder (0 if undefined)
cytomine_working_path=/bigdata/tmp/cytomine/
cytomine_zoom_level=3 #zoom level
cytomine_tile_size=512 #size of the tile
cytomine_filter="otsu" #filter applied to the tile (adaptive,binary,otsu)
cytomine_min_area=100 #minimum area of geometries to keep
cytomine_max_area=100000 #maximum area of geometries to keep
cytomine_tile_overlap=0 #overlap between successive tile

#3. Adapt union parameters (to merge geometries over the whole slide by merging local geometries detected in each tile)
cytomine_union_minlength=10 # we consider merging polygons that have at least 20 pixels in common
cytomine_union_bufferoverlap=5 # for each polygon, we look in a surrounding region of 5 pixels for considering neighboor polygons
cytomine_union_area=5000
cytomine_union_min_point_for_simplify=1000  #if an annotation has more than x points after union, it will be simplified (default 10000)
cytomine_union_min_point=500 #minimum number of points for simplified annotation
cytomine_union_max_point=1000 #maximum number of points for simplified annotation
cytomine_union_nb_zones_width=5 #an image is divided into this number of horizontal grid cells to perform lookup
cytomine_union_nb_zones_height=5 #an image is divided into this number of vertical grid cells to perform lookup



#Note: The script will go through a whole image at given zoom_level, apply filtering at each tile,
# and upload detected connected components (eventually with term id) to Cytomine server. It then
# perform a union to merge connected components that intersect accross tiles (e.g. cell clusters)
# Warning: the script saves each tile locally to an existing directory
# $working_path/image-id_image-tile*** (see code)
