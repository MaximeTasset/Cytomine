# Cytomine-python-datamining

This folder contains application examples for different image analysis tasks.
These algorithms generally download image data from Cytomine-Core, process them
(e.g. segment or classify), and upload results (e.g. annotation geometries
and associated terms (e.g. cell category) or properties (e.g. cell counts))
to Cytomine-core. Annotation objects that are created by these algorithms can then
be proofread using Review modules on Cytomine-WebUI.

1) classification_validation
* Summary: It downloads from Cytomine-Core annotation images from project(s) and evaluates annotation classification models by cross-validation. No model is saved. It generates confusion matrices that are visible in the Cytomine Web UI

* Typical application: object (e.g. cell) classification algorithm evaluation.
